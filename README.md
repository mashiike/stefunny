stefunny is a deployment tool for [AWS StepFunctions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) state machine and the accompanying [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) rule.

stefunny does,

- Create a state machine.
- Create a scheduled rule.
- Update state machine definition / configuration / tags 
- Update a scheduled rule.

That's all for now.

stefunny does not,

- Manage resources related to the StepFunctions state machine.
    - e.g. IAM Role, Resources called by state machine, Trigger rule that is not a schedule, CloudWatch LogGroup, etc...
- Manage StepFunctions Activities and Activity Worker.

If you hope to manage these resources **collectively**, we recommend other deployment tools ([AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/), etc.).

If you hope to manage these resources **partially individually**, we recommend the following tools:

 - [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for IAM Role, CloudWatch LogGroups, etc... 
 - [lambroll](https://github.com/fujiwara/lambroll) for AWS Lambda function.
 - [ecspresso](https://github.com/kayac/ecspresso) for AWS ECS Task.

   --tfstate value         URL to terraform.tfstate referenced in config [$STEFUNNY_TFSTATE]
   --help, -h              show help (default: false)
```

## Quick Start

stefunny can easily manage for your existing StepFunctions StateMachine by codes.

Try `stefunny init` for your StepFunctions StateMachine with option `--state-machine`.

```console
stefunny init --region ap-northeast-1 --config config.yaml --state-machine HelloWorld 
2021/11/23 18:08:00 [notice] StateMachine/HelloWorld save state machine definition to definition.jsonnet
2021/11/23 18:08:00 [notice] StateMachine/HelloWorld save config to config.yaml
```
**If you want to manage StateMachine definition in other formats**, use the `--definition` option and specify the definition file. The default is jsonnet format, but you can use json format (.json) and yaml format (.yaml, .yml)

Let me see the generated files config.yaml, and definition.jsonnet.

And then, you already can deploy the service by stefunny!

```console
$ stefunny deploy --config config.yaml
```

### Deploy

```console
NAME:
   stefunny deploy - deploy StepFunctions StateMachine and Event Bridge Rule.

USAGE:
   stefunny deploy [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --dry-run  dry run (default: false)
```
stefunny deploy works as below.

- Create / Update State Machine from config file and definition file(yaml/json/jsonnet)
  - Replace {{ env `FOO` `bar` }} syntax in the config file and definition file to environment variable "FOO".
    If "FOO" is not defined, replaced by "bar"
  - Replace {{ must_env `FOO` }} syntax in the config file and definition file to environment variable "FOO".
    If "FOO" is not defined, abort immediately.
  - If a terraform state is given in --tfstate, replace the {{tfstate `<tf resource name>`}} syntax in the config file and definition file with reference to the state content.
- Create/ Update EventBridge rule.

### Schedule Enabled/Disabled

```console
NAME:
   stefunny schedule - schedule Bridge Rule without deploy StepFunctions StateMachine.

USAGE:
   stefunny schedule [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --dry-run   dry run (default: false)
   --enabled   set schedule rule enabled (default: false)
   --disabled  set schedule rule disabled (default: false)
```

```console
$ stefunny -config config.yaml schedule --disabled
```

Update the rules in EventBridge to disable the state. This is done without updating the state machine.

### Render 

```console
NAME:
   stefunny render - render state machine definition(the Amazon States Language) as a dot file

USAGE:
   stefunny render [arguments...]
```

```console
$ stefunny -config config.yaml render hello_world.dot
```

The Render command reads the definition file, interprets the ASL and renders the State relationship into a DOT file.

### config file (yaml)

```yaml
required_version: ">v0.0.0"

state_machine:
  name: hello_world
  definition: hello_world.asl.jsonnet
  role_arn: "{{ tfstae `aws_iam_role.stepfunctions.arn` }}"
  logging_configuration:
    level: ALL
    destinations:
      - cloudwatch_log_group:
          log_group_arn: "{{ must_env `LOG_GROUP_ARN` }}"

tags:
  env: "{{ must_env `ENV` }}" 

schedule:
  expression: rate(1 hour)
  role_arn: "{{ tfstae `aws_iam_role.eventbridge.arn` }}"
```

Configuration files and definition files are read by go-config. go-config has template functions env, must_env and json_escape.

## Special Thanks

@fujiwara has given me naming idea of stefunny.
